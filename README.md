# Light-Meter
This is an Arduino project in which I am controlling the servo motor using a photoresistor. A photoresistor is an electronic device which detects light falling on it.
When light falls on it, its resistance decreases which leads to increase in current value.

## Components Used
1. Photo-resistor
2. Servo Motor
3. Arduino UNO R3
4. 1k ohm resistor
